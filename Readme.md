# Drag-n-drop-objects

An experiment with objects illustrating domain concepts with interaction possibilities through direct manipulation.

## Example: Inbox with applications

The user's task is to look at loan _applications_ and decide on whether to reject them, ask for more information or create an offer for a loan.

The _inbox_ contains applications that has arrived. It is illustrated as a stack of _folders_, the representation of applications.

The user pulls out an application and opens it. The user can close it again and leave it on their _desk_.

The folder contains _documents_, the first being the form that the _customer_ filled out when creating the application.

See [doc/application.png](doc/application.png) for a possible illustration.
